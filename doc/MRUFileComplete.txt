DESCRIPTION					 *MRUFileComplete-description*

This plugin offers an alternative completion that works like the general one,
but lists completion candidates only from files that were recently used
(regardless of whether the file is still loaded into a Vim buffer or not).
By default, the 10 files edited when you last exited Vim
(|viminfo-file-marks|) are used, but any MRU-plugin that exposes the list of
remembered files can be configured as a source, too.

SOURCE									     *
(Original Vim tip, Stack Overflow answer, ...)

SEE ALSO								     *

- Check out the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

==============================================================================
USAGE						       *MRUFileComplete-usage*

In insert mode, invoke the completion via CTRL-X CTRL-R.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.
							     *i_CTRL-X_CTRL-R*
CTRL-X CTRL-R		Find matches for words that start with the
			keyword in front of the cursor, looking only into
			recently used files.
							     *v_CTRL-X_CTRL-R*
{Visual}CTRL-X CTRL-R	Find matches for words that start with the
			selected text, looking only into recently used files.

			Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-R will copy the words
			following the previous expansion.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*MRUFileComplete-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-MRUFileComplete
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim MRUFileComplete*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					*MRUFileComplete-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.036 or
  higher.
- Requires the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin (vimscript #3914), version 1.60 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				       *MRUFileComplete-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
			*g:MRUFileComplete_MRUGenerator*
The plugin requires a List of filespecs that represent the recently used
files. By default, these are taken from the numbered marks (|'0|..'9). If you
use another MRU plugin, you can configure its files as the completion source
by defining a Funcref that is invoked without arguments, and expected to
return a List of filespecs: >
    let g:MRUFileComplete_MRUGenerator = function('MruMenu#Get')
<
						       *MRUFileComplete-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(MRUFileComplete) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-x><C-r> <Plug>(MRUFileComplete)
    vmap <C-x><C-r> <Plug>(MRUFileComplete)
<
